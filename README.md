# Weather-Report

# Description 
The goal of this application was to pull the current weather for a city in real time along with the 5 day forecast utilizing javascript, .moment and web APIs. I learned how to utilize web api and fetch/.then to pull information that I need to display to the webpage that I created. The difficulty that came to me in this process was trying to create buttons with the past searches utilizing localStorage. I also found difficulty in the different API that I had to use to create this page.
