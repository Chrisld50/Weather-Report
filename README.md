# Weather-Report

# User Story
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

# Description 
* This application utilizes the Openweathermap API and Javascript to create a 5 day weather forecast.
* The user can type in the city they would like to check the weather on and a current weather for that time will be shown as well as a 5 day forecast.
* The forecast includes the temperature, the UV, the wind speed and humidity levels for that day.
* The city that is called will be saved and can be clicked on to show the data.
* The color changes on the UV description for green being good UV, yellow being moderate and red being severe. 


The goal of this application was to pull the current weather for a city in real time along with the 5 day forecast utilizing javascript, .moment and web APIs. I learned how to utilize web api and fetch/.then to pull information that I need to display to the webpage that I created. The difficulty that came to me in this process was trying to create buttons with the past searches utilizing localStorage. I also found difficulty in the different API that I had to use to create this page.
